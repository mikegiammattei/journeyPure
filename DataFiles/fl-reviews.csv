Rehabs,8/19/2019,Florida,Dan V.,5,It is a wonderful program as long as you pay attention. I have learned a lot from being there. The main thing is you have to do it for you and give it 100%.

I definitely would recommend this facility to anyone who wants to learn a new way of life.,

Rehabs,2/3/2018,Florida,Tim M.,4,"I had the pleasure of staying at Journey Pure for 30 days. During my stay, I was able to gain the mental clarity and focus to break the final bonds of my addiction. Journey Pure incorporates the best facets of the 12-steps with evidence-based techniques from the human growth movement, cognitive behavior and others. They were open and willing to explore new ideas which was particularly refreshing. Being able to pick from the very best of these is what sets them apart. Structured enough to keep you motivated and lax enough to experience epiphanies. I would recommend it to anyone ready to take action steps on their path to sobriety.",
Rehabs,1/15/2018,Florida,Jeff C.,5,I've been to other rehabs before and Journey Pure is by far the best. It is an amazing facility with the latest recovery tools.,
Rehabs,1/8/2018,Florida,Julie J.,5,This place is amazing. I have nothing but great things to say. They took me in off the streets and treated me with love and compassion that every human deserves. The staff really cares about the wellbeing of the patients. I have been to other places where that wasn't the case. JourneyPure is growing every day and it makes me happy to see that more people are getting the treatment they need.,
Rehabs,1/8/2018,Florida,Matthew B.,4,"Treatment effectiveness was top-notch. The staff has a true passion for helping a fellow addict. Without them, I wouldn't have stayed. Big thanks to the staff for sure. Meditation, process groups, all great. One thing I would change is the transition from detox to residential to the beach houses. They change your therapist, and I believe you should have just one for a 30-day period. Other than that, superb. Accommodations...Beach view houses of the gulf. Vans could use some attention to detail. The center is great. Clean, organized and cozy. Meals & nutrition...They have a great Chef for sure so when you are at detox or residential, you don't have to cook. Meals are great and JP will accommodate to your diet, big plus. Once at the beach houses, you make a list every week and eat like kings. You also cook for yourself and others in the beach houses. Overall...I will have to say this place is great. If you are serious about recovery and want a big change take a chance here. It is a great place. ",

Rehabs,10/5/2017,Florida,Dylan L.,5,"Journey Pure quite literally changed my life. You get out of this program what you put into it. There is no cure for this disease, but there is a remedy. You have a choice in life. Your decisions and how you respond to stressors and emotions. I've learned various coping skills through the Journey Pure program, and I can honestly say that the path I was on would have taken my life. Journey Pure taught me skills that saved my life.

The staff will readily assist any needs pertinent to recovery needs and concerns. I'm very grateful to have been accommodated in the program in every area I reached out on and underlying needs I knew very little of. They helped me come out of myself and that is not a repayable gift. Thank you jp.",

Rehabs,7/12/2017,Florida,Henry K.,5,"JourneyPure in Panama City Beach, FL changed my life! It wasn't just a rehab. It was a family bound together with one goal - to stay sober. The staff are family and you won't find anyone who cares about you like they do. They treat you like the human beings you are and not like you are just another addict. One particular therapist is a beautiful soul and my favorite. A few key staff will lead you to the best sober living homes you can find. They are also my absolute favorites! The house managers are wonderful, the funniest and most sarcastic women you'll meet, but they treat you as if you are their own. They changed my life and everyone was phenomenal! I met friends who will last a lifetime😉 Just be willing and they will lead you towards the right path. It's your choice to continue on that path! Plus, the houses are beautiful with a pool! What more could you ask for?!",
Rehabs,3/28/2017,Florida,Caleb U.,5,"I spent a total of 80 days inpatient there, so I can speak from a great amount of experience of the facility and staff. First, the detox section is amazing! I have never been so well taken care of treated so kindly! The detox staff are amazing people who care! The intake team is available and will get you situated fast! Secondly, they offer 2 inpatient treatment options, traditional and Christian. The Christian tract is led by 2 phenomenal therapists. It changed my life. The traditional track is equally great and is led by a team of awesome counselors! Also, the residential houses are like something out of a movie. They are 3 story houses literally across the street from the most beautiful beaches. They provide you with all you could need, and the houses are staffed 24hrs a day!  Finally, the leadership at Journey Pure are awesome people! They were always available and caring. If I needed to talk, I felt comfortable enough to go to their offices! Also, after you leave they don't just forget about you. The aftercare coach will periodically harass you via every type of messaging service. Lol. They care! If I had any complaint is that the days are long. The day starts early and ends late but w didn't mind that when we were out using, so it's worth the investment! I highly suggest this place to anyone at any age at any stage of addiction. The psychiatrist on staff will get you situated quickly without habit-forming medications! Call them, its the first step to a new life. Feel free to message me with any questions. My motivation is to help the still-suffering addict!",
Rehabs,9/20/2015,Florida,Helen H.,5,"The staff at Journey Pure is very kind and understanding. They are there for me, every step of the way. Without them, my life would be very different...The Florida location is a definite plus as well!",
google,9/19/2019,Florida,Jerry Harris,5,"15 months ago, the only option I had was death...plain and simple. I didn't love myself enough to even want to live anymore. It wasn't until I completely surrendered that I heard a voice that told me ""not yet."" That night, I was led to JourneyPure in Panama City Beach. I took a leap of faith to travel 2,000 miles to a city I had never been and to put my recovery in the hands of people that were complete strangers to me. But, because of the love and support of the staff at this facility, I have a foundation to begin a new life of sobriety. I began to TRULY live my life. More importantly, I began to love MYSELF again. I can not fully articulate how much these people mean to me. If you're looking for a facility to give you the tools to live on life's terms, to give you the most rudimentary building blocks to have a shot in the world, to help be that CALM in the middle of your chaos-filled life, then THIS is a good starting place. Thank you JourneyPure Emerald Coast.  Jerry H. - Alcoholic",
google,8/2/2019,Florida,Richard Ware,5,"How can I describe getting my life back? JouneyPure's staff is the reason I am writing this. I'm not sure where I'd be if not for them. The counselors and staff are the finest. All of my concerns - medical and psychological - were taken care of day or night. My well being and treatment was at the top of every staff member's goal list. The follow up is truly genuine. My Coach tracks my progress through an app on my phone on a daily basis. I feel like there's still someone I can turn to if I need help - that security is very important to me and my sobriety. Thanks, Journey Pure.	 ",
